 ## Memory Tiles
 
 This is my Interactive Front-end Development project. I created a simple memory game which grows in complexity with each level. 
 
 
### Strategy 

My Goal is to design a memory game that is fun, intuitive and user friendly. The page will be simplistic and easy to navigate around. 
Its purpose is to provide the user with a enjoyable game. 


### Scope :
This page is to provide users with quick access to a memory game. The Game is to challenge the users memory and have them remember a sequence of flip tiles and the order in which they appear. 

### Structure
The game buttons are displayed on a black background. Three options are presented to the user, "start", "tutorial" and "strictmode". 

The start game button triggers the game container to bounce down. Four black tiles appear, upon commencement one tile flips over displaying a colour which the user must remember its location. Placed above the four tiles is an "exit" button which allows the user to return the main menu. 
The tutorial button triggers a modal. The modal contains "step by step" insturctions. These include a desciption of how to play along with corresponding images. 
The strictmode option is a simple checkbox which the user can select if they wish to play the game in strictmode. 

### Skeleton:
I created a wireframe using the program "Miro".
