 ## Memory Tiles
 
 This is my Interactive Front-end Development project. I created a simple memory game which grows in complexity with each level. 
 
 
### Strategy 

My Goal is to design a memory game that is fun, intuitive and user friendly. The page will be simplistic and easy to navigate around. 
Its purpose is to provide the user with a enjoyable game. 


### Scope 
This page is to provide users with quick access to a memory game. The Game is to challenge the users memory and have them remember a sequence of flip tiles and the order in which they appear. 

### Structure
The game buttons are displayed on a black background. Three options are presented to the user, "start", "tutorial" and "strictmode". 

The start game button triggers the game container to bounce down. Four black tiles appear, upon commencement one tile flips over displaying a colour which the user must remember its location. Placed above the four tiles is an "exit" button which allows the user to return the main menu. 
The tutorial button triggers a modal. The modal contains "step by step" insturctions. These include a desciption of how to play along with corresponding images. 
The strictmode option is a simple checkbox which the user can select if they wish to play the game in strictmode. 

### Skeleton
I created a wireframe using the program "Miro".

### Surface
For the surface plane I wanted the design and colour scheme to be minimalist. My surface design was inspired by popular games such as Defender and Pacman. On the back side of the flip tiles I used neon colours, which create a fun contrast with the black background. The buttons turn white when hovered over to help the user identify which button they wish to click. 

For the typography I used google fonts and applied  the "coda caption" font family to all the text and headers on the page. I found this font  to be very clear and legible which will accomadate any users who may suffer with visual impairments. 
The "WAIT" and "GO" text were coloured yellow and green, this emmualtes the traffic light colour scheme. Giving the user an intrinsic link between when to stop and go,again this calls to any users who may have reading difficulties who could potentially grasp the notion through the colours used.
